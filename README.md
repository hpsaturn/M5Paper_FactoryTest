# M5Paper_Zenreader

[Watch video](https://youtu.be/NYiZOIYzch8)

PlatformIO Project for M5Paper based on the FactoryTest app. Makes your M5Paper an E-ink RSS Reader with built-in Reader mode, to solve annoyances with the Kindle Experimental browser.

You'll need a FAT32-formatted SD card installed for the znreader to work properly.

You'll need to open this project in platformio for VSCode to compile this, I will try to find other ways to make it less painful in the future.

By default it uses my personal server to proxy the reader mode and RSS feed filtering, so please don't abuse it.
